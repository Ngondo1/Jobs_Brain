            <h2>Welcome </h2>
            <p> Hey, what is going on, Karibu sana. Warm welcome to the Job vs Internship dicussion. This journal aims to explore the differences and similarities between job opportunities and internship opportunities, providing valuable insights for both job seekers and employers.</p>
            <h2>Research based version</h2>
            <div class="research-flex" style="display:flex;align-items:center;gap:2rem;flex-wrap:wrap;">
                <div style="flex:2;min-width:220px;">
                    <p>Since time in memorial, learning has been mandatory in order for a learner to mastering of any skill. Nobody is born with thier brain prefixed with knowledge, and hence the need for internship has always been recognised as crutial for skill development. Internship offers real-world experience and mentorship in a special way that entry level jobs dont provide to beginners.<br>
                    Internships, especaiily unpaid and voluntary ones, have always shown the mentor that the learner is dedicated and loyal to learning rather than a paycheck. This offers the learner greater respect and freedom to learn rather than be tied down to one role and repetitive tasks.<br>
                    Additionally, the learning curve of an intern is very steep. Interns are called interns for a reason, they start learning about a  given practice with little or no knowledge about it. By the end of a successful internship, the learner's brain gains new connections which sharpen problem-solving abilities in virtually all other areas of life.<br>
                    Last but not least, Internships offer future career moves, esentially allowing the intern to hold on to thier cards as the plans switch along the way.</p>

                        <li><b>60%</b> of paid interns receive at least one job offer after graduation, compared to 36% of those with no internship experience (NACE, 2023).</li>
                        <li>Internships increase employability and skill acquisition, with <b>70%</b> of employers offering full-time positions to their interns (Forbes, 2021).</li>
                        <li>Learning new skills through internships can increase neural connections in the brain, supporting cognitive growth and adaptability (Liang et al., 2019).</li>

                            • Internships as we know them emerged in the 20th century.<br>
                            • In the 1970s, only ~3% of US college students did internships; by 2010s, over 60%.<br>
                            • Digitalization since 1980s led to exponential growth in recorded data.<br>
                            • Apprenticeships dominated before 1850; formal internships and entry-level programs grew rapidly after 1950.

            <h2>My Take</h2>
            <p>
                I prefer internships, specifically over jobs. Why? In an internship, you work just as much as a job, but initially, you had no capability to perform the given job at hand. Hence, at the end, you get to learn how something that was completely unknown to your brain, which makes your brain sharper. Additionally, internship without pay leaves you free from being tied down to one particular boss, giving you a chance to pursue your own interests while offering free service at the price of being taught by a master in a certain job.
