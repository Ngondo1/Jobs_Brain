            <p>
                The human control room is located in the brain. In the brain, there are the specific names of the departments and drivers of human activity such as the hypothalamus. Each part of the brain is specific and intentional and is used to carry out specific pools of activities. There is the biological analysis that has shown that the brain is connected using neural connections and there is the weight of the neural connections that determines how intense the connections are at any given time, and this intensity is what allows humans to focus and use their brain efficiently. Now, there is the aspect of cognitive load which essentially stands for the amount of neuron connections a part of the brain can withstand at any given time and this can vary drastically based on the usage of the brain. Essentially, the brain scans of someone who constantly uses their brain to tackle new things to the brain over time will show a bigger neural connection level within their brain than someone who constantly does the same thing and doesn't actively strengthen the neural connections within their brain.
