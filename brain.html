            <p>
                Cognitive load Theory is a concept that was introduced in 1988 by Mr. John Sweller. Mr. Sweller wanted to explain how the human brain processes and stores information during the learning process. The idea of our working memory having limited capacity resonated very well with any learner that had experiened burn out.  <br><br>
                Mr. Sweller's research identified three types of cognitive loads namely : <br><br>
                1. Intrinsic Load: This is the load of trying to  learn something new, from basic maths to advanced calculus.  It is influenced by the complexity of the material and the learner's prior knowledge. <br><br>
                2. Extraneous Load: This refers to the way the learning content is taught to the brain. For example, the same advanced calculus could be taught using complex words and complex formulas making it more confusing and complicated. Poorly designed instructional materials can increase extraneous load, making it harder for learners to process information. <br><br>
                3. Germane Load: This is the mental effort equivalent to horsepower in machines. This can vary depending on the excerise that the brain has done in the past. It is the load that contributes to learning and is influenced by the learner's engagement and motivation. <br><br>

            <h2>My Take</h2>
            <p>
                The human control room is located in the brain. In the brain, there are the specific names of the departments and drivers of human activity such as the hypothalamus. Each part of the brain is specific and intentional and is used to carry out specific pools of activities. There is the biological analysis that has shown that the brain is connected using neural connections and there is the weight of the neural connections that determines how intense the connections are at any given time, and this intensity is what allows humans to focus and use their brain efficiently. Now, there is the aspect of cognitive load which essentially stands for the amount of neuron connections a part of the brain can withstand at any given time and this can vary drastically based on the usage of the brain. Essentially, the brain scans of someone who constantly uses their brain to tackle new things to the brain over time will show a bigger neural connection level within their brain than someone who constantly does the same thing and doesn't actively strengthen the neural connections within their brain.
